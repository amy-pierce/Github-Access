# Github-Access
CS3012
## Project Description
This project had two aspects to it:
- Integrate the GitHub Api to retreive and display data 
- Integrate the GitHub API to build visualisation of the data retreived
## My General Solution Idea
- for this project I decided to build a web application using react.js. I have never used react before but  remeber from CS2013 last year that some groups used react to make web sites and apps and I thought this would be a good experience to branch out and try something new like react.
-The graphs I drew use Plotly, which is based on d3.js libraries to create social graphs and represnet the data in different ways.
## Video Demo
## Graphs
### Profile Details
The first graph I made was a simple bar chart that once a user is searched and fond, displayed the amount of followers they have, how many people they follow and the amount of repositories they have.This was a simple enough graph to make and helped me get to grips with using plotly to represet different data.

### Languges
The next graph I made was a pie chart that represenst the percentage of each language a user utilizes throughout their repositories.
